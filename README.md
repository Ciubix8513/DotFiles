These are the config files I use

Currently includes:
- Zsh
- Kitty
- Lunar vim
- Rofi
- Spotify (Spicetify)
- Swayfx
- Waybar
- Sway interactive screenshot

The file setup.sh just puts all the config files in appropriate places, creating directories if necessary

For the font I use [my fork of Monocraft](https://github.com/Ciubix8513/Monocraft) (untill it's hopefully merged)
